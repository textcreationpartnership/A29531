            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof all kind of dangerous and damnable <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormious practiſes, with unbrotherly and unchriſtian diviſions, have broke in upon us, to the rendring of us a ſcorn and deriſion to the Nations round about.

This is conceived to have affected the Diſciples of Chriſt, as the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſets it forth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.1. <hi>His Diſciples came</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>to ſhew him the buildings of the Temple.</hi> This they did, as by way of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,</hi> being much taken with the rich mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of the ſtructure, ſo alſo out of <hi>pity</hi> and commiſeration, in as much as their maſter had but a little before given them a hint of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction thereof; cap. 23.38. <hi>[Behold, your houſe is left unto you deſolate]</hi> intimating that both the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed. Hereupon they now ſhewed him the buildings thereof, as pittying that ſad fate, that ſo ſtately a fabrick ſhould be ruined. This moved them; And I will not ſay but it might alſo at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent affect their maſter, when he had this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proſpect in his eye: to think what after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſpeaks verſe 44. that the enemy ſhould <hi>lay</hi> that <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple even with the ground, not leaving one ſtone upon another.</hi> This poſſibly might move ſome compaſſion in him.</p>

            <p>Weeping (we ſee) was no new or ſtrange thing with our Saviour. That ever he <hi>laughed,</hi> that we read not; that he <hi>wept</hi> we meet with it more then once.</p>

               <hi>A.</hi> To this it is anſwered: Firſt, This he did, to <hi>ſhew the truth of his humanity:</hi>

He <hi>could</hi> have done it, but he <hi>would</hi> not. And why? Becauſe he came not to do his own will, but the will of him that ſent him. As he came to preach his <hi>Word,</hi> not his own, <hi>My doctrine is not mine own, but his that ſent me,</hi> Joh. 7.16.

Other things there were, which in a <hi>Political</hi> and civil way might have tended to the outward peace, the temporal proſperity of that place. But none like this, none like <hi>Chriſt</hi> who is the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> Iſai. 9.6. And <hi>our peace,</hi> Epheſ. 2.14. In him is the ſalvation of a people bound up. This it is which maketh a people truly happy: <hi>The knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this knowledge the inhabitants of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> were deſtitute of. They neither did, nor would know this their <hi>Peace-maker.

               <hi>Q.</hi> 3. But what did not they <hi>know</hi> him? had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:41952:19"/> they not heard of him?<note place="margin">How they are ſaid not to know theſe things, viz. in not own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt.</note> Nay had they not both heard and ſeen him? heard his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> ſeen his <hi>Miracles?</hi> A.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">By whom it was.</note>A. To this it is anſwered, True, Chriſt was thus acknowledged by ſome and many at this time. But by whom was it?

And it was no otherwiſe with the <hi>body of the people,</hi> who were generally led (as for the moſt part they are) by the example of their Rulers.

            </p>
            <p>Lo then, <hi>How deplorable a thing it is, for a people not to receive Chriſt and his Goſpel being offered and tendered unto them.</hi> This is the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation</hi> I am now to proſecute.

This is the thing which our Saviour here ſo paſſionately laments and bewails. And the ſame we find him doing again elſewhere, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. where he breaketh forth into the like pathetical exclamation. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her wings, and ye would not.] O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem!</hi> the word is doubled to intimate the ſtrong affection of the ſpeaker. <hi>How often would I have gathered thy children?</hi> meaning the people of the Jews, whoſe <hi>mother City</hi> was <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> This he had attempted by ſending his meſſengers, his ſervants unto them, then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, to admoniſh them, warn them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort them, ſo ſtriving to bring them to faith and repentance, that ſo they might have been ſheltred from the wrath of God, and ſecured from thoſe imminent evils which hang over their heads. But they <hi>would not.</hi> They reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the offers of grace made unto them. And this is the matter of our Saviours, <hi>lamentation,</hi> the thing which drew theſe tears from his eyes.

This being entertained brings peace along with it. It was the commiſſion and direction which our <hi>Saviour</hi> gave to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> when he ſent them forth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.12, 13. <hi>When ye enter into a houſe, ſalute it, and if the houſe be worthy</hi> (that is, ſuch perſons as are willing and ready to entertain you and your meſſage) <hi>now let your peace come upon it.</hi> Now preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of peace to them, and therewith wiſh all good and happineſſe unto them: which alſo accordingly ſhall come and <hi>reſt</hi> upon them. So Saint <hi>Luke</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.6. <hi>If the ſonne of peace be there,</hi> (meaning ſuch perſons as were readily diſpoſed to receive the doctrine of peace; the Goſpel) <hi>your peace ſhall reſt upon it,</hi>

Thus is it with a <hi>family,</hi> And thus is it with a <hi>City,</hi> and thus is it with a <hi>Nation.</hi> The receiving of the Goſpel is the happineſſe of it.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the <hi>rejecting of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> is the <hi>undoing</hi> of a people.<note place="margin">The reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel the undoing of a people.</note> So it there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you, nor hear your words, when ye depart out of that houſe, or City, ſhake of the duſt of your feet.</hi> This were the Apoſtles to do as a token of Gods ſhaking them off.

Thereby intimating not onely his deſerting, but Gods rejecting of them. Of ſuch ſad conſequence is it for a people not to give entertainment to the Goſpel, and the meſſengers thereof.

As the Prophet <hi>Iſai.</hi> chap. 60.1. <hi>Ariſe, ſhine</hi> (or <hi>be enlightned) for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee.</hi> So Zachary 9.9. <hi>Rejoyce greatly O daughter of Sion, for thy King cometh unto thee.</hi> Both which had their accompliſhment in the coming of Chriſt in the fleſh; and particularly in his coming to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> at this time, in this manner, preſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it as a <hi>King.</hi> So he himſelf applies the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of theſe Texts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.4, 5. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon is this here called <hi>Jeruſalems day;</hi> the day that had been ſo often foretold; the time wherein God did offer grace and mercy to her after a more ſpecial manner then ever he had done heretofore. Before he had often made of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of that kind unto her (as to the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews) by ſending his <hi>Prophets</hi> to her. But now he doeth it by his <hi>Son.</hi> So our Saviour ſets it forth in that known parable of the <hi>Vineyard,</hi> Matth. 21.33, &amp;c. <hi>A certain man planted a vineyard.]</hi> This <hi>vineyard</hi> was the <hi>Church of the Jews</hi> (Iſaiah 5.1.) whom God took to be a peculiar people to himſelf, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:41952:34"/> like offices thereunto that the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would do to his vineyard. Being thus planted he <hi>let it forth to husbandmen, and went himſelf into a far Countrey;]</hi> God ſeemed to leave that Church wholly to the care of the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> In proceſs of time he <hi>ſends his ſervants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits thereof,</hi> verſe 34.] God ſends his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> to this Church, whom (by the Parable goeth on) <hi>they beat and ſlew,</hi> verſ. 35. So they did the former Prophets many of them. <hi>Againe he ſent other ſervants, moe then the firſt, and they did unto them likewiſe,</hi> verſe 36. Before the Captivity he ſent more Prophets to them then formerly, who found no better entertainment then the former. <hi>But laſt of all he ſent unto them his ſon,</hi> verſe 37. God the Father ſends his Son <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the world, with a ſpecial meſſuage unto the Jews, to require from them the fruits of all that grace and favour which had been ſhewen to them. And this was <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalems day.</hi> The time of ſpecial grace and mercy offered unto them after a ſpecial manner. and that by Chriſt himſelf, wherein ſhe had a ſpecial opportunity tendered unto her, if ſhe had but had the wiſdome to accept it, to lay hold of it, and make uſe of it accordingly. Even the <hi>time of her viſitation,</hi> as the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe after the Text explains it.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>hinc illae lachrymae,</hi> this was a matter of juſt lamentation. The <hi>day</hi> was come, and even now ſpent, but <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> had not an eye

God had made known to them the things belonging to their peace formerly; he had ſent his <hi>Prophets</hi> to them from time to time for that purpoſe; but now he did it more clearly, by ſending his <hi>Son</hi> to ſpeak to them, to tender himſelf to them in perſon. Now this rendred their neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contempt a great deal more heinous and inexcuſable; that <hi>even in this their day</hi> they ſhould not know, &amp;c.

Thus where God is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to afford men but a little light, (ſuch as that was under the <hi>Law,</hi> which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> compareth to a <hi>Candle,</hi> a <hi>Light ſhinning in a dark place</hi> (as that place is by ſome expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:41952:37"/> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19.) for men not to give heed unto that light, and take notice of the minde of God which is held forth by it, is a great neglect; but when the <hi>day-ſtar ariſeth,</hi> a clear light breaketh forth, ſuch as <hi>Goſpel-light</hi> is; now for men to ſhut their eies againſt the light, or not to make uſe of it by walking an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably to it, this is an high contempt, of which <hi>Calvin</hi> here ſaith rightly, <hi>Contemptum manet ſeverior vindicta;</hi> it hath a greater ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance waiting upon it, then if it were a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple neglect.

Notwithſtanding that it had been clearly revealed and held forth unto them, yet they ſhut their eies againſt the Light. This is that which our Saviour char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth upon this people, the people of the Jews
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:41952:44"/> in that known place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Light is come into the world, but men loved darkneſſe rather then light.</hi> So was it with the generalitie of that Nation. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was the <hi>light of the world,</hi> he was come into the world, and in particular come unto them, declaring and making known to them what belonged to their peace.

How ſo? The reaſon followeth in the next verſe. <hi>For this peoples heart is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eies they have cloſed; leſt they ſhould at any time ſee with their eies, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Such was the wilful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacie of that people, that they even ſtopped their ears againſt the <hi>Word</hi> of Chriſt, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their eies againſt his <hi>Works,</hi> they would
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:41952:44"/> not ſee what belonged to their peace; and in this way it came to be <hi>hid from their eies.</hi> And this our Saviour here taketh up as a juſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Lamentation</hi> to him, and <hi>Exprobration</hi> to them; bewailing them for it, and upbraiding them with it.</p>

So it was with this people, the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as our Saviour alſo taketh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, giving this as a reaſon why they did not believe, <hi>John</hi> 12.39, 40. <hi>Therefore they could not believe,</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>becauſe Iſaias ſaid again, He hath blinded their eies, and hardned their hearts, that they ſhould not ſee with their eies, and underſtand with their hearts, and bee converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi> Thus dealt God with that people, juſtly puniſhing their wilful obſtinacie, by giving them up unto a reprobate ſence, to a ſpiritual blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and obduracie. In as much as they had firſt blinded themſelves, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their own eies againſt the light <hi>[Their eies they have cloſed]</hi> (ſo

This is the reaſon which the ſame Apoſtle giveth, why thoſe of that Nation did not ſee what was ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly held forth unto them in the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Their mindes were blinded, there was a veil up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hearts</hi> (as the next <hi>ver.</hi> hath it). God hath given them up in his juſt judgment for their contempt of the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:41952:59"/> means of grace to a fearful excera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obduration, blinding their eies, and hardning their hearts. Thus the Lord is ſaid to have done <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs, Exod.</hi> 4.21. And the like is ſaid of <hi>Sihon</hi> King of <hi>Heſhbon,</hi> that refuſed to let <hi>Iſrael</hi> paſſe by him, <hi>Deuteronom.</hi> 2.30. <hi>The Lord thy God hardned his ſpirit, and made his heart obſtinate, that he might deliver him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy hand.</hi> This hee did, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by with-holding his grace from them, but by delivering them up unto the perverſneſſe of their own ſpirits, and to Satan, to bee acted by him unto their ruine and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And after the like manner may God bee ſaid to have hardned the hearts of this people, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> not onely by with-holding his <hi>Spirit</hi> from them, but alſo giving them up unto their own <hi>hearts luſts</hi> (as rhe Pſalmiſt hath it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.11, 12. <hi>My people would not hearken unto my voice, and Iſrael would none of mee, So I gave them up to their own hearts luſts;</hi> (or, as the margin readeth it, to the <hi>hardneſſe of their hearts) and they walked in their own counſels</hi>), and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:41952:59"/> to the power of <hi>Satan</hi> to bee acted by him, to bee blinded and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by him. Yea, even giving Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his <hi>Word</hi> to have ſuch an accidental effect upon them; even as the <hi>Sun</hi> hath upon the <hi>Clay,</hi> to harden it. So much wee may learn from that Text of the Prophet <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> cited by our Saviour, <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. Where the Lord giving him his Commiſſion to go unto that people, hee bids him (or rather foretelleth him what hee ſhould do) that hee ſhould make their heart fat. <hi>Make thou the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavie, and ſhut their eies, &amp;c.</hi> Now how ſhoula hee do this? Why onely by preaching the Word to them. But what then, had the Word any ſuch proper o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of it ſelf? Not ſo: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had the Prophet any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in the preaching of it; but through their obſtinate tempers it become ſo to them, an occaſion of their further blinding and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. God in his juſt judgment <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> and <hi>ordering</hi> that his Word ſhould have ſuch a direfull effect
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:41952:60"/> upon them, as that they ſhould grow worſe and worſe by it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they ſhould attain to that height of impenitencie, as ſhould bee irrecoverable. This it is, The <hi>Word</hi> will have it work, one way or other, beeing (as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith) <hi>the favour of life, or of death,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 2.16. Where it doth not open and clear the eye, it will cloſe and blinde it: Where it doth not ſoften the heart, it will harden it. And in this way, and by this means doth God in his moſt righteous Judgment, <hi>hide from the eyes of men the things which belong to their peace,</hi> which they have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſee.</p>

No, as my prayers have been and ſhall be, ſo my hopes yet are to the contrary; that God will yet be merciful to this Nation; and I want not ſome grounds to bottom theſe hopes upon.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Not ſeeing what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to peace in his day.</note>Among which let the firſt and principal be, <hi>our not ſeeing the thing which betmged to our peace in our day.</hi> Where I ſhall not do (what happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with too much evidence of truth I might), de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to thoſe particular times and ſeaſons wherein mercy hath been held forth and offered unto this Nation, in a more ſignal and remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner. Surely ſuch <hi>Criticall daies</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath had, and ſome of them, within our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorie, ſeaſons and opportunities, which had they been laid hold of, and improved as they might, how happy might ſhe have been? I ſhall content my ſelf with generalities. Onely taking notice of that long <hi>day of grace</hi> and mercy which this Nation hath had; during which the light of the Goſpel hath ſhone forth to it, and that in ſo clear and glorious a manner as (I ſuppoſe without flatterie I may ſpeak it) it hath not done to any other nation under heaven.

Hath <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell</hi> found that intertainment among the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity which he expected, and it deſerved? The <hi>Generalitie</hi> (I ſay) True it is, ſome there have been, and at this day are, who have ſincerely imbraced both; And ſo there were in Jeruſalem,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:41952:61"/> ſome that cryed <hi>Hoſanna to the Some of David, Hoſanna in the higheſt,</hi> Matth. 21.9, 15. But how is it with the greateſt part? do not they yet love darkneſſe, rather then light? ſetting light, by the light of the Goſpel, and the Miniſtery thereof; even <hi>Gadarene like</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring their ſwine before <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> A charge, wherein I wiſh there were not too much truth, Such ſleight and ſlender entertainment hath the Goſpell, with the faithful meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thereof, found among the greateſt part of this Nation. A ſad <hi>prognoſtick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Specially if it be conſidered to what a height this diſaffection is at this day improved,<note place="margin">Diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the perſons and Calling of Miniſters a ſad prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick.</note> and riſen even to the diſclaiming and crying down of the <hi>Miniſtery</hi> it ſelf. So is it with ſome, and not a few. They are growen diſaffected, not onely to the <hi>perſons</hi> of Miniſters, but even to their <hi>fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> and <hi>calling,</hi> diſclaiming that as <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> Thus, are the <hi>feet</hi> of them who <hi>bring glad tidings of peace,</hi> which ſometimes were, and in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are <hi>beautifull,</hi> now become in the eyes of many black and deformed. A ſad ſymptome. So it was in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> of which we read, 2. <hi>Chr.</hi> 36.16. <hi>The Lord God of their fathers ſent to them by his Meſſengers riſing up betimes, and ſending them, becauſe he had compaſſion on his people, on his dwelling place; But they mocked the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of God, and deſpiſed his words, and miſuſed his Prophets, untill the wrath of the Lord roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his people, till there was no remedy,</hi> (no
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:41952:62"/> 
               <hi>Healing.</hi>) This made their diſeaſe incurable, and the wrath of God implacable. When ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men being diſtracted, ſhall flye in the faces of their Phyſitians, and there be none to bind them, what hope of Cure can there be? This was <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalems</hi> caſe, as the Parable ſets it forth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.33. <hi>God</hi> the great <hi>Houſeholder,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>planted a Vineyard,</hi> (the <hi>Jewiſh Church</hi>) and let it forth to <hi>Husbandmen,</hi> (ſo the <hi>Prieſts</hi>) he ſends his <hi>ſervants,</hi> ſome after other, to <hi>receive the fruites thereof,</hi> (his <hi>Prophets</hi> former and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to require that people to bring forth fruits meet for repentance) but they <hi>beat one, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another, and ſtoned another,</hi> (ſo did they uſe the Prophets) Hereupon he ſendeth his <hi>ſonne</hi> (Chriſt himſelf) who met with the like uſage. Now what followe;h hereupon? That you may hear firſt from the mouthes of the <hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to whom our Saviour here propoundeth this Parable, making them judges in the cauſe, that ſo he might co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demn them out of their own mouthes, <hi>They ſay unto him he will miſerably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy theſe wicked men, and will let out his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to other husbandmen, which ſhall render him the fruites in their ſeaſon,</hi> v. 41. which afterwards you find explained and applyed by our Saviour to themſelves, <hi>v.</hi> 43. <hi>Therefore I ſay unto you the Kingdome of God ſhall be taken from you, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a Nation bringing forth the fruit thereof.</hi> When the Miniſters of God come to meet with ſuch intertainment, and that for doing their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, it is a ſad preſage that the Kingdome of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:41952:62"/> God, the Goſpel ſhall not long continue there, and that Judgment is not far from ſuch a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Upon this account our Saviour looketh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> condition as deſperate. <hi>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and stoneſt them which are ſent unto thee; How often would I have gathered thy children together, as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not. Behold your houſe is left unto you deſolate.</hi> Matthew 23.37, 38. Here is a firſt <hi>Prognoſtick,</hi> and that a ſad one.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Let a ſecond be that which I have named and touched upon already.<note place="margin">2 Gods with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the light, by putting out the Candles.</note> Gods <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the light,</hi> by putting out the <hi>Candles,</hi> I mean taking away his Miniſters, who are ſaid to be <hi>the light of the world.</hi> Thus was it done to <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> And whether this be in any degree ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to this Nation or no, I ſhall leave it to thoſe who are privie to the preſent ſtate of it, to judge. Of late how many able and faithfull Miniſters taken away? Now when a Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to call away his <hi>Ambaſſadours,</hi> it is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily looked upon as a <hi>Paſſing-bell</hi> to the peace of that Nation.</p>
            <p>Repl. But howſoever (it may be ſaid) ſome be by <hi>Providence</hi> taken away, yet others by the like providence are ſubſtituted in their roomes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> True it may be in ſome places,<note place="margin">Many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of true Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</note> but not ſo in all. Some <hi>Candlesticks</hi> there are at this day, (and I ſuppoſe not a few,) deſtitute of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles;</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:41952:63"/> not well knowing where to find a ſupply.</p>
            <p>Again, as for thoſe which are thus ſubſtituted by the <hi>providence</hi> of God, are they alſo all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by his Ordinance? Are there not ſome (and not a few) <hi>Ambaſſadours without their commiſſion?</hi> men running before they are ſent; not called nor impowred to do any Miniſteriall act, which yet (<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> like) they attempt to do; that not onely to preach, (which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle will tell us none can do except they be <hi>ſent,</hi> Rom. 10.15. <hi>ſpeak</hi> they may, but not <hi>Preach,</hi> which is an <hi>act of office</hi>) but alſo (ſome of them) to adminiſter the <hi>Seales,</hi> the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> And by this means the Church in many places co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be deprived of an <hi>Ordinance,</hi> upon which all other publick Ordinances have a dependance; I mean of a true <hi>Goſpell Miniſterie,</hi> with which <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath promiſed his ſpecial counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>Thirdly. To this add (in the third place) that where means are continued,<note place="margin">3 The Spirit with draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from the means.</note> yet is not the <hi>Spirit withdrawen?</hi> So was it with <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> they injoyed Ordinances, but there was no life in them; the <hi>Glorie of the Lord was gone up from the Cherub.</hi> And is it not ſo in many parts of this Nation at this day. <hi>Ordinances</hi> remain, but is not the <hi>glorie</hi> of the Lord departed from them? where is that life, where is that power, which heretofore appeared in them? God hath yet his <hi>Armies</hi> of <hi>Prophets,</hi> many faithfull and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters, who may be looked upon as the <hi>Chariots and Horſemen of Iſrael,</hi> but he doth not
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:41952:63"/> go forth with theſe his Armies as formerly, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch ſucceſſe unto the labours of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants as heretofore he hath done. How is it that in many places where the word is purely and powerfully preached, there are ſuch thin Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as there are (ſpecially upon the week daies) in compariſon of what they have been, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to come, not willing to lend an eare to any but their own; others neglecting to come out of an irreligious prophaneſſe: and among thoſe that do come, yet how few conſtant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable attendants upon this Ordinance? A plain evidence that this ordinance hath loſt much of that reſpect, as alſo of that power that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it hath had.</p>
            <p>And what I ſay of the word, I may alſo apply it to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> the Sacrament of the <hi>Lords Supper.</hi> Which though held forth in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and moſt comfortable way of Adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to <hi>Chriſts Inſtitution,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches primitive practiſe,</hi> yet how is it by many ſleighted and neglected? So as thoſe who here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore were wont to come (as it now ſeemeth) for <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>faſhion,</hi> being now left to themſelves, will not come for <hi>love.</hi> The <hi>feaſt</hi> is prepared, and the <hi>Gueſts</hi> invited, but they find ſome <hi>excuſe</hi> or other to keep them away. A thing which I wiſh there were not too juſt cauſe to complain of even in this place. Now ſurely, among other, this is alſo a ſad token.</p>
            <p n="4">4.<note place="margin">4 The eyes of many blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> To which let me add thoſe other which I have alſo made mention of. Gods <hi>blinding the

All ſadly remarkable in this Nation at this day; I think never more in any. And what may we conceive theſe to portend? Surely, ſad Omens they are; giving us too juſt cauſe to fear, leſt God ſhould be about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, to take away his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> his <hi>Goſpel</hi> from us, which meeteeh not only with ſuch ſleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, but ſuch affronts and oppoſitions as it doth.</p>

               <note place="margin">5 Judgments not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by.</note>5.

This is that which the Lord complaines of againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſai. 1.5. <hi>why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more, ye will revolt more and more.</hi> Gods judgments had a contrary effect upon them to what they were intended. He corrected them for their amendment, thereby to bring them home to himſelf, but they took occaſion thereby to go further away from him; ſo as his <hi>Corrections</hi> were <hi>in vain</hi> to them, (as elſwhere he complains) <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.30. <hi>In vaine have I ſmitten your children, they received no correction.] viz.</hi> ſo as to be bettered by it, but rather waxed worſe &amp; worſe. And would to God that this did not lie as too juſt a charge againſt this ſad Land and Nation wherein we live! That God hath ſtricken us, I ſuppoſe there are few but are in ſome kinde or other ſenſible. But
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:41952:64"/> what effect have theſe <hi>Rods,</hi> theſe Judgments had upon us? Are we better by them? Are we thereby reclaimed, reformed, brought home to God? Are we made the more humble, the more careful, the more watchful, the more fruitful? O that theſe effects were to be found amongſt us, But is it not clean contrary? Are we not grown more <hi>proud</hi> (a ſin I think never ſo viſible in this Nation as at this day) more remiſs, more looſe, more barren and unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful then ever? And if ſo, what juſt cauſe have we to fear leſt the Lord in his moſt righteous judgment do unto us, as there he threatens unto <hi>Iſrael;</hi> give us over, ſtriving no longer with us, but leaving us to our ſelves, <hi>letting us alone</hi> (as elſwhere he threatens unto <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hoſ. 4.17.) to go on in our ſinful provocations, until there be <hi>no remedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of thoſe grounds upon which we may build our too juſt fears. To which I might yet have added ſome other. But I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear any further charge: Coming rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,</p>

            <p>So doing, now knew we for our Comfort,<note place="margin">God not willing to caſt off a people in Covenant.</note> that we have to deal with a <hi>God gracious and mercifull, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſſe, ready to repent of what ever evill he</hi> intendeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a people; Eſpecially his <hi>own people;</hi> not willing to reject and caſt off a people that are in <hi>Covenant</hi> with him. So much he expreſſed to this people, the people of the <hi>Jewes</hi> before the Captivity, by making ſo many <hi>removes</hi> before his final departure from them, ſo the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw it in his Viſions; in which the <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord</hi> removed not leſſe then five ſeveral times before it took its leave; Firſt, from the <hi>Cherub</hi> to the <hi>threſhold of the houſe</hi> (the <hi>Temple</hi>) Ezek. 9.3. 2.

Now what did theſe frequent removes import? Surely a great unwillingneſſe in God to depart from that people. And ſo it is, ſo long as there is any remedy; God is not willing to forſake a people, whom once he hath taken into Covenant with himſelf. So much we may hear him paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, declaring concerning <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Hoſ. 11.7, 8. <hi>My people</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are bent to backſliding from me,</hi> (So was <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet mark what followes.) <hi>How ſhall I give thee up O Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee O Iſrael?

How e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, a juſt and righteous thing it is with God God that it ſhould be ſo; that ſeeing you have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:41952:67"/> cloſed your eyes, and would not ſee, that he ſhould ſeal them, ſo as you ſhould not ſee. And if ſo, how deplorable, how miſerable is your condition?

Miſerable and deplorable is the condition of every ſuch a ſoul, in as much as it is now deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, helpleſſe, hopeleſſe. So is it with a perſon upon whom this doom is once paſſed. Now he may call and cry for mercy, with <hi>Eſau</hi> ſeeking bleſſing with tears, but all in vain. Neither his own, nor yet the prayers of any other ſhall be available on his behalf.

So irreverſible was that ſentence which the Lord had paſſed upon <hi>Saul,</hi> that what ever he did, or <hi>Samuel</hi> could do, all could not change the purpoſe of God concerning him.

               <note place="margin">Sometimes he is ſaid to Repent.</note> of what he hath done, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do.

Thoſe who were brought into the vineyard at the <hi>eleventh hour</hi> were none of thoſe that had been called at the firſt, third or ſixt houre, but ſuch as had not been hired before. What ever may happen to others who have not enjoyed the means of grace, or have not been acquainted with the Motions of the Spirit of God, It is not for you who have injoyed the former, an have been acquainted with the latter, and yet withſtand both, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the like unto your ſelves. No, you that have rejected the call of God again and again, in your <hi>Childhood, Youth, Manhood,</hi> you have no ground to hope that God ſhould come unto you, and bring you home to himſelf in your <hi>old age;</hi> but you may rather fear that if he do not cut you off before, he ſhould then hide from your eyes thoſe things, which formerly you have refuſed to know.</p>
